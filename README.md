# Green-Hydrogen-TEA
Designing Off-Grid Green Hydrogen Plants Using Dynamic Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Electrolyzers to Minimize the Cost of Hydrogen Production 

Technoeconomic analysis of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) from a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer that is powered by a variable renewable energy system (solar, wind, or hybrid).

Directory Structure: The python file "Green Hydrogen TEA" performs the following tasks:
1.) Generate a polarization curve
2.) Calculate the LCOH and variable renewable energy to electrolyzer mix under constant operation at 2 A/cm2
3.) Calculate the LCOH and variable renewable energy to electrolyzer mix under dynamic operation at 2 A/cm2
4.) Generate heat maps for LCOH, hydrogen production, and excess power
